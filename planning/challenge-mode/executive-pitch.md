# Challenge Mode: Executive Pitch

## The Hook: Pure Skill Farkle

What if Farkle wasn't just about rolling dice and hoping for the best? What if every game rewarded skill, strategy, and risk management—where the best players could prove their mastery through a gauntlet that separates the lucky from the truly talented?

**Challenge Mode transforms Farkle from a casual dice game into a roguelike experience where every decision matters.**

## The Problem: RNG Without Progression

Current Farkle gameplay has a fundamental limitation:

- **Victory depends heavily on dice luck** - A bad roll can end your turn, and there's nothing you can do about it
- **No meaningful progression within a game** - Every turn feels the same as the last
- **Limited strategic depth** - Bank or roll? That's often the only decision
- **No way to showcase pure skill** - Even the best players can lose to beginners who get hot dice

Players crave a mode where skill and strategy triumph over random chance. They want to feel their expertise translate into consistent success.

## The Solution: Roguelike Challenge Gauntlet

Challenge Mode introduces a **20-bot gauntlet** with escalating difficulty and a revolutionary dice upgrade economy:

### Core Loop

1. **Face 20 sequential bot opponents** with increasing difficulty
2. **Play quick 10-round games** at 3000 points (5-10 minutes each)
3. **Earn $1 for every die you save** when banking
4. **Shop for enhanced dice** after each victory
5. **Build your perfect dice set** through strategic purchases
6. **One loss restarts the entire run** - but the knowledge stays with you

### The Magic: Strategic Dice Upgrades

The shop offers **3 random unique dice per victory**, creating endless variety:

**Tier 1 Dice ($2-3): Early Game Foundation**
- Reliable dice (33% scoring vs 33.33%)
- Extra points (1s = 150, 5s = 75)
- Defensive options (Hot Dice Protection)

**Tier 2 Dice ($4-6): Mid-Game Power**
- Combo enablers (1s/5s wild for straights)
- Streak rewards (consecutive scoring turns)
- Risk mitigation (Farkle Insurance)

**Tier 3 Dice ($6-15): Late-Game Game-Changers**
- Multiplicative scoring (double/triple scoring)
- Reroll mechanics (Mulligan Die)
- Massive risk/reward (Lucky Seven)

Every run feels different. Every shop decision matters. Do you save for that game-changing Tier 3 die, or buy consistency now?

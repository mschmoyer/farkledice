Let's talk game design. We have a basic game loop of farkle with achievements, levels,
tournaments, and AI bot players, but the core gameplay is extremely simple and based on RNG.
Now, with AI bots (who have personalities) We could imagine a challenge mode that plays like a
rogue-like game. 20 farkle bots. See how far you can get before they beat you. Now, how can we
reduce the RNG here? By enhancing your 6 dice! After each round, we could have a store phase
where you can buy dice. When you do, you choose which of your 6 dice to replace. I'm imagining
a store showing 3 dice to choose from with a cost below each and a short description. When you
click purchase, a dialog allows you to choose which of your dice to replace with the new one.
This does mean when the player starts challenge mode, we need to keep track of their 6 dice.
Somehow the player has to earn money, Let's say $1 for each dice you save (so each time the
player rolls or scores, count how many new dice are saved and add $1 for each), regardless of
if you forkle or not (to reduce RNG of money). Let's draw up this plan in the
/planning/challenge-mode folder. First write up the executive pitch. Then draw up an
implementation plan. Finally, slap together some quick mocks of the screens involved.
Parallelize when you are ready to write documents in parallel tasks and use subagents to
explore and research. Please ask any clarifying questions using Claude UI until you fully
understand this feature and read it back to me each time you ask more questions. Put on your
best game design hat and help me make this the best challenge mode this ancient farkle game
could have!
